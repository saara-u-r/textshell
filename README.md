   - Clone the repository containing the source code to your local machine using Git: 

     ``` 

     git clone <repository_url> 

     ``` 

   - Alternatively, download the repository as a ZIP file and extract it to a directory on your local machine. 

  

2. **Compile the Program:** 

   - Navigate to the directory where the source code is located. 

   - Compile the program using a C compiler (e.g., GCC): 

     ``` 

     gcc -o program_name source_code.c 

     ``` 

   - Replace `program_name` with the desired name for the executable file. 

  

### Running the Program: 

  

Once the program is compiled, you can run it from the command line using the following syntax: 

  

``` 

./program_name <command> [filename] [additional_arguments] 

``` 

  

Replace `program_name` with the name of the compiled executable file. 

  

### Examples: 

  

1. **Run a Command:** 

   - To create a new file named `new_file.txt`, run: 

     ``` 

     ./program_name create new_file.txt 

     ``` 

  

2. **Perform Text Manipulation:** 

   - To convert the text in a file named `input.txt` to uppercase, run: 

     ``` 

     ./program_name toupper input.txt 

     ``` 

  

3. **View System Information:** 

   - To display system status, run: 

     ``` 

     ./program_name systemstatus 

     ``` 

  

4. **Play a Game:** 

   - To play the guess the number game, run: 

     ``` 

     ./program_name guessnumber 

     ``` 

  

### Notes: 

- Ensure that you have necessary permissions to create, delete, and modify files in the specified directories. 

- Some commands may require superuser (root) privileges to execute certain system operations. 

- Make sure to provide valid filenames and additional arguments as required by each command. 

  

Follow these steps to install and run the command-line utility on your system. Adjust the instructions based on your specific operating system and environment. 

  

### Dependencies 

Based on the provided source code, the command-line utility does not appear to have any external dependencies beyond the standard C libraries. Therefore, there are no specific dependencies required to run the program. 

  

The program should compile and run on any system with a C compiler (such as GCC) and standard C libraries installed. As such, it should be compatible with most Unix-like operating systems (e.g., Linux, macOS) as well as Windows systems with a compatible C compiler environment (e.g., MinGW, Cygwin). 

  

Ensure that you have a C compiler installed on your system to compile the source code into an executable. Once compiled, the resulting executable should be able to run without any additional dependencies.
